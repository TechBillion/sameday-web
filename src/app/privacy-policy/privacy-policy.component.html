                    but they are primarily held electronically. We manage our records to help us to better serve our customers (for example for operational reasons, such as dealing with any queries relating to your account) and to comply with legal and
                    regulatory requirements.

                    the country in which the relevant Samedaylko company is located and the applicable local legal or regulatory requirements. We (and other Samedaylko group companies) normally keep customer account records for up to six years after your
                    relationship with Samedaylko ends. Retention periods may be changed from time to time (or waived where deemed low-risk) based on business or legal and regulatory requirements. Where there has been no activity on your Samedaylko account
                    since it was opened, we we will routinely delete your data after a period of 6 months, as you will be deemed an “unactivated user”.

                <p>If there has been any transactional activity on your account, we will maintain your data until you request that we delete it, unless we are obligated to maintain such data to comply with our legal obligations. We may on exception retain
                    your information for longer periods than those stated above, particularly where we need to withhold destruction or disposal based on an order from the courts or an investigation by law enforcement agencies or our regulators. This is
                    intended to make sure that Samedaylko will be able to produce records as evidence, if they’re needed. If you would like more information about how long we keep your information, please contact us at:
